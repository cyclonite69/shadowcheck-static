## [Unreleased]

### Added

- OpenAPI 3.0 specification for comprehensive API documentation
- Husky pre-commit hooks with ESLint, Prettier, and secret detection
- Node.js version management with `.nvmrc` file
- Manufacturer field population via radio_manufacturers table JOIN
- Comprehensive regression tests for networks API data integrity

### Changed

- Improved development workflow with automated code quality checks
- Networks API now uses latest observation data instead of aggregated materialized view
- Max distance calculation uses real PostGIS ST_Distance instead of signal strength arithmetic
- WiGLE observations table schema updated from 'public' to 'app' namespace

### Fixed

- GeoSpatial table page showing incorrect default values (signal: 0 dBm, channel: 0, frequency: 0 MHz)
- Analytics widgets failures (Temporal Activity, Radio Types Over Time, Threat Score Trends)
- Max distance calculation returning ~238m instead of real geographic distances
- Threat score column sorting issues (rule_score, ml_score, ml_weight, ml_boost columns)
- WiGLE observation points not rendering due to schema mismatch
- Manufacturer field population with proper OUI prefix matching from BSSID MAC addresses
- Frontend data transformer field name mismatches (network_type → type, avg_score → avgScore)
- Missing API calls for temporal, radio-time, and threat-trends analytics endpoints
