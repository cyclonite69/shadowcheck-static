## Total Free Capacity

**With all 4 keys:**
- **260,500 requests/day**
- **7.8 million requests/month**

**Current database:**
- ~28,000 addresses need enrichment
- With keys: ~30 minutes to complete
- Without keys: ~8 hours to complete

## Usage

```bash
# Add keys to .env file
nano .env

# Run fast enrichment (uses all available APIs)
node enrich-addresses-fast.js 10000

# Check progress
tail -f address_enrich_fast.log
```

## Performance

**Without API keys (current):**
- Speed: ~100 addresses/hour
- APIs: Overpass + Nominatim only
- Rate limited: 1 req/second

**With API keys:**
- Speed: ~1,000 addresses/hour
- APIs: All 4 in parallel
- Rate limited: 5 concurrent requests

## Recommended Strategy

1. **Start now** with free Overpass/Nominatim (no keys needed)
2. **Sign up** for LocationIQ (fastest signup, 5k/day)
3. **Add HERE** for massive capacity (250k/month)
4. **Optional**: OpenCage + Geoapify for redundancy

## Current Status

```bash
# Check how many addresses need enrichment
docker exec shadowcheck_postgres_18 psql -U postgres -d shadowcheck -c \
  "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM app.networks_legacy WHERE trilat_address IS NOT NULL AND venue_name IS NULL;"

# Check enrichment progress
tail -f address_enrich_fast.log
```
