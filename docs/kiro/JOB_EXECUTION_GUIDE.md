# 🚀 HOW TO USE THE JOB MANIFEST

This is your systematic approach to professional polish.

---

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Use With Claude (This Conversation)

```
Say to me:
"Run JOB-01: Project Structure Analysis"

I will:
1. Execute the analysis
2. Generate the output file
3. Report findings
4. Ask for next job
```

### Option 2: Use With Kiro-CLI

```bash
kiro run-job shadowcheck JOB-01 --manifest docs/kiro/KIRO_JOBS.md
```

### Option 3: Manual Execution

Read each job description and execute yourself, reporting findings back to me.

## Recommended Workflow

### Start Here (Today - 2-3 hours)

**Run Phase 1 & 2 in order:**

```
JOB-01 → JOB-02 → JOB-03 → JOB-04 → JOB-05
JOB-06 → JOB-07 → JOB-08 → JOB-09 → JOB-10
```

This gives us:

- Complete picture of project state
- Build/test results
- Documentation inventory
- Issues to fix

### Then (Tomorrow - 3-4 hours)

**Run Phase 3 (Documentation):**

```
JOB-11 → JOB-12 → JOB-13 → JOB-14 → JOB-15 → JOB-16
```

This generates:

- Architecture docs
- Threat model docs
- Use cases
- API reference
- Deployment guide
- Contributing guide

### Then (Next 2-3 hours)

**Run Phase 4 (Polish):**

```
JOB-17 → JOB-18 → JOB-19 → JOB-20 → JOB-21 → JOB-22
```

This cleans up:

- Unused imports
- Debug code
- Type safety
- Comments
- Constants
- Performance

### Finally (1-2 hours)

**Run Phase 5 (Show-Off Ready):**

```
JOB-23 → JOB-24 → JOB-25 → JOB-26 → JOB-27
```

This delivers:

- Professional README
- Organized GitHub
- Verified deployment
- Demo script
- Final checklist

## How Jobs Work

### Each Job Has:

**Purpose:** Why we're doing this

**What to do:** Specific steps or commands

**Expected output:** What should result

**Success criteria:** How to know it's done

### Example: JOB-02

```
Purpose: Verify build pipeline works

What to do:
1. Run: npm run build
2. Capture output
3. Check bundle size
4. Run: npm run type-check
5. Create: BUILD_STATUS.md

Expected output:
- Build passes/fails documented
- Bundle size known
- TS errors counted

Success criteria:
- All errors logged
- No surprises
```

---

## How to Report Back

After each job, tell me:

```
✅ JOB-XX: [Job Name]

RESULTS:
- [Key finding 1]
- [Key finding 2]
- [Any blockers or issues]

OUTPUT FILES CREATED:
- [filename.md]

NEXT JOB:
JOB-XX: [Next job name]
```

---

## If You Find Issues

**When a job discovers problems:**

Option A: I fix it for you immediately  
Option B: I document it for later (Phase 4)  
Option C: We skip it (it's not critical)

The job manifest is flexible. If something blocks progress, we pivot.

## Expected Outcomes

### After Phase 1-2 (Today)

- Know exact state of codebase
- Know what works, what doesn't
- Know what needs fixing
- Have baseline metrics

### After Phase 3 (Tomorrow)

- Professional documentation
- Architecture explained
- Uses cases positioned
- API documented
- Deployment guides ready

### After Phase 4 (Next day)

- Clean, polished code
- No debug artifacts
- Type-safe
- Performance optimized

### After Phase 5 (Final)

- Show-off ready
- Can share publicly
- Proud of presentation
- Professional quality

## Jobs That Require Your Input

Some jobs need YOU to answer questions:

**JOB-12:** Explain threat detection methodology (from your knowledge)  
**JOB-13:** Document use cases (from your vision)  
**JOB-23:** Create compelling README (your positioning)  
**JOB-26:** Create demo script (your demo strategy)

I can draft these, but YOU should refine them.

## Starting Now

**Tell me:**

```
"Start Phase 1: Run JOB-01 through JOB-05"
```

I will execute each in order and report findings.

Or if you want to start manually:

```bash
cd /path/to/shadowcheck-static
# And follow JOB-01 instructions
```

## The Philosophy

This isn't a checklist to rush through. It's a **systematic approach to excellence**.

Each job builds on the previous. Each output informs the next decision.

**The goal:** When someone sees this project, they think:

> "This person knows what they're doing. This is professional. This is trustworthy."

That credibility is what sells the vision.

**Ready to execute?**

Reply with one of:

- "Start Phase 1" (I run jobs 1-5)
- "Start Phase 1 & 2" (I run jobs 1-10)
- "Let's go full speed" (I execute all phases in sequence)
- "I'll do these manually and report back"

Let's ship this. 🚀
