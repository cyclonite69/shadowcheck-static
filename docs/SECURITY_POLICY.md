## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability in ShadowCheck-Static, please report it privately:

1. **DO NOT** open a public GitHub issue
2. Email: [Your security contact email]
3. Include detailed steps to reproduce
4. Allow reasonable time for a fix before public disclosure

## Secure Development Practices

This project follows strict security guidelines:

### No Secrets in Code
- ✅ All credentials stored in encrypted keyring (~/.local/share/shadowcheck/keyring.enc)
- ✅ .env files are gitignored and contain only placeholders
- ✅ API keys never committed to version control
- ✅ Database passwords retrieved from system keyring

### Security Features
- AES-256-GCM encryption for credential storage
- Machine-specific encryption keys
- Rate limiting (1000 req/15min per IP)
- CORS origin restrictions
- Input validation on all endpoints
- SQL injection protection via parameterized queries

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.x.x   | :white_check_mark: |

## Known Security Considerations

1. **Keyring Storage**: File-based encrypted keyring (~/.local/share/shadowcheck/)
   - Only accessible by the user who created it
   - Uses machine-specific encryption key
   - Not suitable for multi-user environments without additional access controls

2. **Admin Interface**: Protected by API key authentication
   - API key should be stored securely (in keyring)
   - Change default API key in production

3. **Database**: PostgreSQL with PostGIS
   - Credentials should never be hardcoded
   - Use environment variables or keyring for passwords
   - Enable SSL connections in production

## Security Audit History

- **2025-12-04**: Comprehensive security audit completed
  - Fixed XSS vulnerabilities in frontend
  - Removed hardcoded credentials
  - Implemented encrypted keyring storage
  - Added CORS restrictions
  - Added request size limiting
