# PostgreSQL Security Configuration
# Prevents password exposure in logs

# Logging - Disable statement logging to prevent password exposure
log_statement = 'none'              # Don't log SQL statements (prevents password leaks)
log_connections = off               # Don't log connection attempts
log_disconnections = off            # Don't log disconnections
log_duration = off                  # Don't log query durations

# Alternative: Log only DDL (no passwords in CREATE/ALTER/DROP)
# log_statement = 'ddl'

# Alternative: Log errors only (recommended for production debugging)
# log_min_messages = error
# log_min_error_statement = error

# Connection logging (if needed for auditing, but increases risk)
# log_connections = on              # Enable only if required for compliance
# log_disconnections = on           # Enable only if required for compliance

# Note: These settings prevent passwords from appearing in:
# - PostgreSQL logs
# - pg_stat_statements
# - Query history
# - Error messages

# For development/debugging, you can temporarily enable logging:
# ALTER SYSTEM SET log_statement = 'all';
# SELECT pg_reload_conf();
# 
# Remember to disable after debugging:
# ALTER SYSTEM SET log_statement = 'none';
# SELECT pg_reload_conf();
